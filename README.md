# Benefesser_deshaw_project
Building the framework for charity foundation. The aim of this project is to connect people who are willing to donate with the charities and NGOs in need. It lets donors know of the problems faced by unprivileged sections of the society and offers them easy access to some of the charity organizations where they can donate and track their donations. On the other hand, it facilitates the fund raising process for charities.
